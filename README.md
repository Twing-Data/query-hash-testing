# query-hash-testing

At Twing Data, we wanted to test the query hashing approaches across different database engines.

- Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-hash
- Redshift: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/10/amazon-redshift-query-identifiers-performance-monitoring/

We wrote a blog post summarizing the results and will continue to update it as we test more database engines: https://www.twingdata.com/blog/query-hash-testing
